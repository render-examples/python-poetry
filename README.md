# Poetry Support

[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org) is a Python packaging and dependency management tool.

[Render](https://render.com) has native support for Poetry in the `Python` environment.

In this app we use Poetry to manage dependencies for a [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) [quick start](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/quickstart/#a-minimal-application) example.

The app is deployed at [https://flask-poetry.onrender.com](https://flask-poetry.onrender.com).
